# User Management API
### Overview:
This repository comes with methods for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying users to manage user management. Each addition creates a unique key with uuidv4, which is assigned under an object with its corresponding values. You can use the unique id generated by uuidv4 to perform subsequent add, delete, update, and display operations.
### Setup:
To set up the project, follow these steps:
* Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env.
* Edit the properties in the .env file as follows:
  * Set the APP_NAME property to your application name.
  * Set the APP_PORT property to the port you want your application to run on.
